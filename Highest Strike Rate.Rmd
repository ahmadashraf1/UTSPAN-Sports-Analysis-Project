## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
deliveries
```

```{r}
deliveries2 <- deliveries %>%
  filter(over == '16' | over == '17' | over == '18' | over == '19' | over == '20') %>%
  group_by(batsman) %>%
  summarise(balls_faced = n(),
            runs_scored = sum(batsman_runs),
            strike_rate =  runs_scored/balls_faced*100) %>%
  arrange(desc(strike_rate))
deliveries2
```

```{r}
deliveries3 <- deliveries2 %>%
  filter(balls_faced >= 10)
head(deliveries3)
```
